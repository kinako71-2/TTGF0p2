## How it works

A simple one-stage RISC-V CPU.
This CPU was created with reference to the lecture: https://eeic-vlsi.github.io/2025/.
Instructions are 32-bit, while the input bus is 8-bit, so each instruction is loaded over four clock cycles.

## How to test

Very simple instructions are written in the testbench to verify that the calculations are correct.

## External hardware

The chip is not being shipped at this time.
